Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## What You Learned

You're making fantastic progress! This week in particular, you learned how to do the following:

* Build interactive command-line applications that process user input.

* Explain modularization and how it relates to npm and the standard library.

* Initialize new Node.js projects with npm, and install and import dependencies.

* Explain the importance and usefulness of ES6+ concepts such as `let`, `const`, and arrow functions.

* Handle asynchronicity with callbacks and Promises.

### Node.js in the Workplace

Since its invention in 2009, Node.js has become extremely popular. According to the [StackOverflow 2023 State of Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-web-frameworks-and-technologies), Node.js is the most popular non-language, non-database development tool. Its speed, low cost, and scalability led large tech companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and eBay to adopt it into their applications. An interesting side effect of this adoption has been the blurring of the lines between traditional developer roles.

You see, traditionally front-end and back-end developers used different programming languages&mdash;a company may have been using JavaScript on the front end and PHP on the back end. Then Node.js entered and enabled JavaScript developers to work across the two sides. Thus, it is now likely that you will see front-end developers using Node.js to quickly develop a server-side application, even if they have little experience with back-end development principles. Alternatively, back-end developers who are working with Node.js are able to more effectively communicate with front-end development and review front-end code. You might also see companies taking advantage of this cross-platform JavaScript expertise usage by pulling talent from the front-end team onto the back-end team, and vice versa.

Finally, full-stack developer roles were also impacted by Node.js, in that they can now use one programming language for all of their programming responsibilities. This increases development efficiency, enables full-stack developers to reuse code, and enables products to scale more smoothly. It also enables prospective full-stack developers (perhaps you are one of them?)  to find a career fit by gaining a deep understanding of JavaScript, instead of learning multiple programming languages.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Create Your Resume

Your resume is your chance to impress an employer with your skills and accomplishments. A resume that focuses on results, uses dynamic language, and appears organized, clean, and free of mistakes will stand out from the crowd. Let’s walk together through the essential components of a resume.

#### Headers

* Include name, phone number, professional email address, city and state, postal code, and complete hyperlinks to LinkedIn and your portfolio (if applicable).

#### Summary section

* Title of role pursuing.

* Background experience that connects to the role you are pursuing.

* 2&ndash;3 transferable skills.

* Years of related experience.

* Accomplishments, recognitions, and awards.

* Relevant training or certificates.

Below is an example of a header and summary that follows these guidelines:

### Skills section

* Includes industry-specific and transferable skills. Ensure technologies conform to standard spelling and style for the industry.

* Focus on industry-specific skills and concepts you obtained in your program.

### Projects

* List projects completed in your boot camp. Follow this format to list your projects:

  ```text
  **Project Name | Link to GitHub | Link to Deployed Project**  [always write out link address]
  ```

* Short summary of project (1&ndash;2 lines)

* Your core responsibilities in project (1&ndash;2 lines)

* Tools/languages used

### Experience section

* Experience listed in reverse chronological order, with job title, job description, company name, city and state/province, and dates of employment.

* If applicable, include previous field-specific experience.

* Start every bullet with an action verb; don’t use the same verb more than once.

* Cite accomplishments, recognitions, and awards.

* Bullets are concise, direct, and listed in order of importance.

* Quantify work as much as possible.

* Briefly define job role and team size where it provides context to the scope and depth of your work.

### Education section

* List education at the end of the resume unless you don’t have much professional experience or you have particularly relevant degrees.

* Include your program as the most recent item under education.

### Design and Format

* Clear and simple design.

* No template language or blank areas.

* Design does not get in the way of necessary text/content.

* Text fills the page without overcrowding.

* Balanced margins, between 0.5"&ndash;1."

* No more than one page if new to the field, two pages if have relevant experience.

* Consistent and professional font style. It’s okay to use different fonts for the headings and body. Professional font styles include: Arial, Calibri, Cambria, Georgia, Helvetica, and Times New Roman.

* Consistent use of bold, italic, and underline. Same bullet-point for all lists.

### Clear and Professional Tone

* Consistent punctuation throughout.

* No grammatical or spelling errors.

* No personal pronouns (I, we, he, or she).

* No abbreviations or acronyms unless technical terms are well-known and used in the industry.

* No jargon, slang, or superlative adjectives like “great,” “good,” or “awesome.”

## Prepare for Next Week

If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

In the next module, you'll learn about **object-oriented programming**, or OOP&mdash;a topic that is very concept-heavy. It might seem difficult at first, but understanding it is important in becoming employer-competitive. Don't worry if you don't immediately understand it; it's perfectly normal to feel a little lost at first!
